Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. 
As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, 
they also want to use the most current and effective software security.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

It is important to code securely because there is also someone out there that wants to take advantage of a program. 
In the specific case of Artemis Finacial it was of major importance to code securely becuase they are a company that deals with finances. A company is only as strong as their security so it adds lots of value when it comes to customers trusting the company. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Honestly the process of adminersting and reading the static test and its result were the most challening and most helpful. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I was able to increase layers of security by making sure to add security to all inputs. You never know what inputs you can trust so protecting from the beginning is crucial. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Maven test and coverage is something that i will use in future assingments now that I sort of know how to do them.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I owuld show employers that I know how to code securely and that I now know how to run and read different teset to ensure that the program is secure.
